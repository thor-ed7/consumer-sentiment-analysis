# consumer-sentiment-analysis
This is a Python based Machine learning project that analyze the consumer sentimental behaviour on reviews on Amazon
Data_Set has been acquired from Kaggle
Implemented using the VADERS and Roberta Modelsof language processing.
Transformers Implementation through pipeline is also discussed at the end of the Project

Steps to run the Notebook-
  1. Just run the jupyter notebook named Code_Sentiment_Analysis file and run all the cells.
  2. The Roberta Model is trained to process over a GPU and CUDA Tech and usually runs slow on CPU
  3. To accelarate the processing of the ROBERTA Model to the full data set use the GPU kernel instead of ipython.

Libraries Used- Transformers, Pandas, Numpy, NLTK, VADERS, ROBERTA
